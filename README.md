## Installation

simply download the repo and run the index.html
> as of (2025/05/23) if your not using a server you will get a CORS error
> If you use Vscode I recommed getting live server!

## Usage
Again I would recommend getting live server... but simple launch index.html

## Contributing
Currently its just me updating the site... and I admit I did have a bit of AI help.... but honestly I was simple copy pasting and changing very few things since I  already had a completed project... don't hate.
